
Question#1:Define Object Oriented Programming Language?

An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. 
To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language.  
 Many modern programming languages are object-oriented, however some older programming languages, such as Pascal, do offer object-oriented versions.
 Examples of object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++ and Smalltalk.

Question#2:List down the Benefits of OOP?

1)Modularity for easier troubleshooting.
2)Reuse of code through inheritance.
3)Flexibility through polymorphism.
4)Effective problem solving.

Question#3:

FUNCTION:
A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). 
All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.
METHOD:
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. 
In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences.
A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class 
(remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition,
 the object is an instance of that data).

Question#4:

CLASS:
In Python, classes are templates. They help you standardize and organize information.
ATTRIBUTE:
Is used for entering individual data.
